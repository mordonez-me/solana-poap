# Solana POAP minter


This project can be used to create a collection and mint nfts from it to a specific list. Each item of the collection will use the same image as the collection, personalize it as needed.


## How to setup


1. Change parameters on settings.ts

```
export const pkPath = PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE
export const imagePath = PATH_TO_COLLECTION_KEY_FILE
export const cluster = URL_OF_THE_CLUSTER
export const collectionSize = NUMBER_OF_NFTS_IN_COLLECTION
export const startDate = START_DATE_TO_ALLOW_MINT // e.g. 2023-01-20T09:00:00Z
export const endDate = END_DATE_TO_DISABLE_MINT // e.g. 2023-01-21T09:00:00Z
export const configFile = PATH_TO_FILE_FOR_CONFIG // This file contains info like candymachine id. This is autogenerated but can be used if just airdrop is needed
export const distributionListFile = PATH_TO_FILE_FOR_AIRDROP_ADDRESSES
export const collectionName = NAME_OF_COLLECTION
export const imageName = NAME_OF_IMAGE // The name to be assigned to imagePath in Arweave
```

2. Add the file defined on distributionListFile variable on setttings.ts

4. Add private key file defined on imagePath variable on setttings.ts
